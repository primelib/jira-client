/**
 * Get2SearchJqlV1
 * <p>
 * Searches for issues using [JQL](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/egORLQ). Recent updates might not be immediately visible in the returned search results. If you need [read-after-write](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/search-and-reconcile/) consistency, you can utilize the `reconcileIssues` parameter to ensure stronger consistency assurances. This operation can be accessed anonymously.
 * 
 * If the JQL query expression is too large to be encoded as a query parameter, use the [POST](#api-rest-api-2-search-post) version of this resource.
 * 
 * **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Issues are included in the response where the user has:
 * 
 *  *  *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project containing the issue.
 *  *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.
