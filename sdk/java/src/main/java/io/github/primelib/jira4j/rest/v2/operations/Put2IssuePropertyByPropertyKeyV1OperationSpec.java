/**
 * Put2IssuePropertyByPropertyKeyV1
 * <p>
 * Sets a property value on multiple issues.
 * 
 * The value set can be a constant or determined by a [Jira expression](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/). Expressions must be computable with constant complexity when applied to a set of issues. Expressions must also comply with the [restrictions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/#restrictions) that apply to all Jira expressions.
 * 
 * The issues to be updated can be specified by a filter.
 * 
 * The filter identifies issues eligible for update using these criteria:
 * 
 *  *  `entityIds` Only issues from this list are eligible.
 *  *  `currentValue` Only issues with the property set to this value are eligible.
 *  *  `hasProperty`:
 *     
 *      *  If *true*, only issues with the property are eligible.
 *      *  If *false*, only issues without the property are eligible.
 * 
 * If more than one criteria is specified, they are joined with the logical *AND*: only issues that satisfy all criteria are eligible.
 * 
 * If an invalid combination of criteria is provided, an error is returned. For example, specifying a `currentValue` and `hasProperty` as *false* would not match any issues (because without the property the property cannot have a value).
 * 
 * The filter is optional. Without the filter all the issues visible to the user and where the user has the EDIT\_ISSUES permission for the issue are considered eligible.
 * 
 * This operation is:
 * 
 *  *  transactional, either all eligible issues are updated or, when errors occur, none are updated.
 *  *  [asynchronous](#async). Follow the `location` link in the response to determine the status of the task and use [Get task](#api-rest-api-2-task-taskId-get) to obtain subsequent updates.
 * 
 * **[Permissions](#permissions) required:**
 * 
 *  *  *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for each project containing issues.
 *  *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.
 *  *  *Edit issues* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for each issue.
