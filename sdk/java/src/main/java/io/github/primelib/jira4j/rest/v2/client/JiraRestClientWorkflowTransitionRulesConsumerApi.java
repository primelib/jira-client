    * Returns a [paginated](#pagination) list of workflows with transition rules. The workflows can be filtered to return only those containing workflow transition rules:
    * 
    *  *  of one or more transition rule types, such as [workflow post functions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/workflow-post-function/).
    *  *  matching one or more transition rule keys.
    * 
    * Only workflows containing transition rules created by the calling [Connect](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/index/#connect-apps) or [Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/index/#forge-apps) app are returned.
    * 
    * Due to server-side optimizations, workflows with an empty list of rules may be returned; these workflows can be ignored.

    * <ul>
    *   <li>startAt: The index of the first item to return in a page of results (page offset).</li>
    *   <li>maxResults: The maximum number of items to return per page.</li>
    *   <li>types: The types of the transition rules to return.</li>
    *   <li>keys: The transition rule class keys, as defined in the Connect or the Forge app descriptor, of the transition rules to return.</li>
    *   <li>workflowNames: The list of workflow names to filter by.</li>
    *   <li>withTags: The list of `tags` to filter by.</li>
    *   <li>draft: Whether draft or published workflows are returned. If not provided, both workflow types are returned.</li>
    *   <li>expand: Use [expand](#expansion) to include additional information in the response. This parameter accepts `transition`, which, for each rule, returns information about the transition the rule is assigned to.</li>
