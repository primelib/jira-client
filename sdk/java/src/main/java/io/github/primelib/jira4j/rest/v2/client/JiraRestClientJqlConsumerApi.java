    * Sanitize JQL queries

    * 
    * For example, if the query contains the clause *project = 'Secret project'*, and a user does not have browse permission for the project "Secret project", the sanitized query replaces the clause with *project = 12345"* (where 12345 is the ID of the project). If a user has the required permission, the clause is not sanitized. If the account ID is null, sanitizing is performed for an anonymous user.
    * 
    * Note that sanitization doesn't make the queries GDPR-compliant, because it doesn't remove user identifiers (username or user key). If you need to make queries GDPR-compliant, use [Convert user identifiers to account IDs in JQL queries](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-jql/#api-rest-api-3-jql-sanitize-post).

    * Before sanitization each JQL query is parsed. The queries are returned in the same order that they were passed.
