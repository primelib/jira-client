    /**
     * Get2GroupuserpickerV1
     * Find users and groups
     * Returns a list of users and groups matching a string. The string is used:
    * 
    *  *  for users, to find a case-insensitive match with display name and e-mail address. Note that if a user has hidden their email address in their user profile, partial matches of the email address will not find the user. An exact match is required.
    *  *  for groups, to find a case-sensitive match with group name.
    * 
    * For example, if the string *tin* is used, records with the display name *Tina*, email address *sarah@tinplatetraining.com*, and the group *accounting* would be returned.
    * 
    * Optionally, the search can be refined to:
    * 
    *  *  the projects and issue types associated with a custom field, such as a user picker. The search can then be further refined to return only users and groups that have permission to view specific:
    *     
    *      *  projects.
    *      *  issue types.
    *     
    *     If multiple projects or issue types are specified, they must be a subset of those enabled for the custom field or no results are returned. For example, if a field is enabled for projects A, B, and C then the search could be limited to projects B and C. However, if the search is limited to projects B and D, nothing is returned.
    *  *  not return Connect app users and groups.
    *  *  return groups that have a case-insensitive match with the query.
    * 
    * The primary use case for this resource is to populate a picker field suggestion list with users or groups. To this end, the returned object includes an `html` field for each list. This field highlights the matched query term in the item name with the HTML strong tag. Also, each list is wrapped in a response object that contains a header for use in a picker, specifically *Showing X of Y matching groups*.
    * 
    * This operation can be accessed anonymously.
    * 
    * **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and groups* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg).
     *
     * API Method: GET /rest/api/2/groupuserpicker
     *
     * @param spec a consumer that creates the payload for this operation. Supports the following properties:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>query: The search string.</li>
     *   <li>maxResults: The maximum number of items to return in each list.</li>
     *   <li>showAvatar: Whether the user avatar should be returned. If an invalid value is provided, the default value is used.</li>
     *   <li>fieldId: The custom field ID of the field this request is for.</li>
     *   <li>projectId: The ID of a project that returned users and groups must have permission to view. To include multiple projects, provide an ampersand-separated list. For example, `projectId=10000&amp;projectId=10001`. This parameter is only used when `fieldId` is present.</li>
     *   <li>issueTypeId: The ID of an issue type that returned users and groups must have permission to view. To include multiple issue types, provide an ampersand-separated list. For example, `issueTypeId=10000&amp;issueTypeId=10001`. Special values, such as `-1` (all standard issue types) and `-2` (all subtask issue types), are supported. This parameter is only used when `fieldId` is present.</li>
     *   <li>avatarSize: The size of the avatar to return. If an invalid value is provided, the default value is used.</li>
     *   <li>caseInsensitive: Whether the search for groups should be case insensitive.</li>
     *   <li>excludeConnectAddons: Whether Connect app users and groups should be excluded from the search results. If an invalid value is provided, the default value is used.</li>
     * </ul>
