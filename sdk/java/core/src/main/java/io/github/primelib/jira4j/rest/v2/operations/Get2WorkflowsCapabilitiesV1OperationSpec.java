 * 
 * ##### Parent or child blocking validator #####
 * 
 * A validator to block the child issue's transition depending on the parent issue's status.
 * 
 *     {
 *        "ruleKey" : "system:parent-or-child-blocking-validator"

 * 
 * ##### Previous status validator #####
 * 
 * A validator that checks if an issue has transitioned through specified previous status(es) before allowing the current transition to occur.
 * 
 *     {
 *        "ruleKey": "system:previous-status-validator",
 *        "parameters": {
 *          "previousStatusIds": "10014",

 * ##### Validate a field value #####
 * 
 * A validation that ensures a specific field's value meets the defined criteria before allowing an issue to transition in the workflow.
 * 
 * Depending on the rule type, the result will vary:
 * 
 * ###### Field required ######
 * 
 *     {
