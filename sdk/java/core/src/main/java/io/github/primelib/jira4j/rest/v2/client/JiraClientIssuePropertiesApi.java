    * The issues to be updated can be specified by a filter.

    *  *  `hasProperty`:

    * If an invalid combination of criteria is provided, an error is returned. For example, specifying a `currentValue` and `hasProperty` as *false* would not match any issues (because without the property the property cannot have a value).
