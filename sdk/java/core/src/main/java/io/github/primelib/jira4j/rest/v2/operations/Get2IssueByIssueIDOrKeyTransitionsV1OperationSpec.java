/**
 * Get2IssueByIssueIDOrKeyTransitionsV1
 * <p>
 * Returns either all transitions or a transition that can be performed by the user on an issue, based on the issue's status.
 * 
 * Note, if a request is made for a transition that does not exist or cannot be performed on the issue, given its status, the response will return any empty transitions list.
 * 
 * This operation can be accessed anonymously.
 * 
 * **[Permissions](#permissions) required: A list or transition is returned only when the user has:**
 * 
 *  *  *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project that the issue is in.
 *  *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.
 * 
 * However, if the user does not have the *Transition issues* [ project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) the response will not list any transitions.
