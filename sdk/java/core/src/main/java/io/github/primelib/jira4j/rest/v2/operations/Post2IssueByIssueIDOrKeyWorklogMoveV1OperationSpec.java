/**
 * Post2IssueByIssueIDOrKeyWorklogMoveV1
 * <p>
 * Moves a list of worklogs from one issue to another. This is an experimental API with several limitations:
 * 
 *  *  You can't move more than 5000 worklogs at once.
 *  *  You can't move worklogs containing an attachment.
 *  *  You can't move worklogs restricted by project roles.
 *  *  No notifications will be sent for moved worklogs.
 *  *  No webhooks or events will be sent for moved worklogs.
 *  *  No issue history will be recorded for moved worklogs.
 * 
 * Time tracking must be enabled in Jira, otherwise this operation returns an error. For more information, see [Configuring time tracking](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/qoXKM).
 * 
 * **[Permissions](#permissions) required:**
 * 
 *  *  *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the projects containing the source and destination issues.
 *  *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.
 *  *  *Delete all worklogs*[ and *Edit all worklogs*](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg)[project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg)
 *  *  If the worklog has visibility restrictions, belongs to the group or has the role visibility is restricted to.
