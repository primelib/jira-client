/**
 * RealAssigneeTypeEnum
 * <p>
 * The type of the assignee that is assigned to issues created with this component, when an assignee cannot be set from the `assigneeType`. For example, `assigneeType` is set to `COMPONENT_LEAD` but no component lead is set. This property is set to one of the following values:
 * 
 *  *  `PROJECT_LEAD` when `assigneeType` is `PROJECT_LEAD` and the project lead has permission to be assigned issues in the project that the component is in.
 *  *  `COMPONENT_LEAD` when `assignee`Type is `COMPONENT_LEAD` and the component lead has permission to be assigned issues in the project that the component is in.
 *  *  `UNASSIGNED` when `assigneeType` is `UNASSIGNED` and Jira is configured to allow unassigned issues.
 *  *  `PROJECT_DEFAULT` when none of the preceding cases are true.
