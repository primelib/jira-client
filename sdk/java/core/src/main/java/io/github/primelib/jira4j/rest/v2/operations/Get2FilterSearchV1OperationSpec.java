/**
 * Get2FilterSearchV1
 * <p>
 * Returns a [paginated](#pagination) list of filters. Use this operation to get:
 * 
 *  *  specific filters, by defining `id` only.
 *  *  filters that match all of the specified attributes. For example, all filters for a user with a particular word in their name. When multiple attributes are specified only filters matching all attributes are returned.
 * 
 * This operation can be accessed anonymously.
 * 
 * **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** None, however, only the following filters that match the query parameters are returned:
 * 
 *  *  filters owned by the user.
 *  *  filters shared with a group that the user is a member of.
 *  *  filters shared with a private project that the user has *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for.
 *  *  filters shared with a public project.
 *  *  filters shared with the public.
