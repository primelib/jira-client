/**
 * Get2RoleV1
 * <p>
 * Gets a list of all project roles, complete with project role details and default actors.
 * 
 * ### About project roles ###
 * 
 * [Project roles](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-project-roles/) are a flexible way to to associate users and groups with projects. In Jira Cloud, the list of project roles is shared globally with all projects, but each project can have a different set of actors associated with it (unlike groups, which have the same membership throughout all Jira applications).
 * 
 * Project roles are used in [permission schemes](#api-rest-api-2-permissionscheme-get), [email notification schemes](#api-rest-api-2-notificationscheme-get), [issue security levels](#api-rest-api-2-issuesecurityschemes-get), [comment visibility](#api-rest-api-2-comment-list-post), and workflow conditions.
 * 
 * #### Members and actors ####
 * 
 * In the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is called an *actor*. An *actor* is a group or user associated with a project role.
 * 
 * Actors may be set as [default members](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-project-roles/#Specifying-'default-members'-for-a-project-role) of the project role or set at the project level:
 * 
 *  *  Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects. The default actors can be removed at the project level later if desired.
 *  *  Actors: Users and groups that are associated with a project role for a project, which may differ from the default actors. This enables you to assign a user to different roles in different projects.
 * 
 * **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).
