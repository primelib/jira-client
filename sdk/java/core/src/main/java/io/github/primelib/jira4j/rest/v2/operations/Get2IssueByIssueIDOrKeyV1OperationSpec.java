/**
 * Get2IssueByIssueIDOrKeyV1
 * <p>
 * Returns the details for an issue.
 * 
 * The issue is identified by its ID or key, however, if the identifier doesn't match an issue, a case-insensitive search and check for moved issues is performed. If a matching issue is found its details are returned, a 302 or other redirect is **not** returned. The issue key returned in the response is the key of the issue found.
 * 
 * This operation can be accessed anonymously.
 * 
 * **[Permissions](#permissions) required:**
 * 
 *  *  *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project that the issue is in.
 *  *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.
