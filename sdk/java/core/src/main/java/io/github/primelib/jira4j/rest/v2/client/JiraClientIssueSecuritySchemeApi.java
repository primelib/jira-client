/**
 * JiraClientIssueSecuritySchemeApi
 *
 * This resource represents issue security schemes, issue security levels, and issue security level members. Use it to get, create, update, and delete issue security schemes or issue security scheme details. Note that only company-managed (classic) projects are supported.
 * 
 * ### About issue security schemes ###
 * 
 * Issue security schemes control which users or groups of users can view an issue. An issue security scheme is made up of multiple security levels. Each level can have users or groups of users assigned to it. The following are valid security level members:
 * 
 *  *  Individual users
 *  *  Groups of users
 *  *  Project roles
 *  *  Issue roles
 *  *  "Anyone", for example to allow anonymous access
 *  *  A (multi-)user or (multi-)group picker custom field
