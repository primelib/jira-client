/**
 * Get2UserAssignableSearchV1
 * <p>
 * Returns a list of users that can be assigned to an issue. Use this operation to find the list of users who can be assigned to:
 * 
 *  *  a new issue, by providing the `projectKeyOrId`.
 *  *  an updated issue, by providing the `issueKey` or `issueId`.
 *  *  to an issue during a transition (workflow action), by providing the `issueKey` or `issueId` and the transition id in `actionDescriptorId`. You can obtain the IDs of an issue's valid transitions using the `transitions` option in the `expand` parameter of [ Get issue](#api-rest-api-2-issue-issueIdOrKey-get).
 * 
 * In all these cases, you can pass an account ID to determine if a user can be assigned to an issue. The user is returned in the response if they can be assigned to the issue or issue transition.
 * 
 * This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users from that range that can be assigned the issue. This means the operation usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who can be assigned the issue, use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-2-users-search-get) and filter the records in your code.
 * 
 * Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users' preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address is hidden. See the [Profile visibility overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/) for more details.
 * 
 * **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and groups* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) or *Assign issues* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg)
