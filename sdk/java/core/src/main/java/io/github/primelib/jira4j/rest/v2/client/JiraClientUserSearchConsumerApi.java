     * Find users assignable to projects
     * Returns a list of users who can be assigned issues in one or more projects. The list may be restricted to users whose attributes match a string.
    * 
    * This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users from that range that can be assigned issues in the projects. This means the operation usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who can be assigned issues in the projects, use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-2-users-search-get) and filter the records in your code.
    * 
    * Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users' preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address is hidden. See the [Profile visibility overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/) for more details.

    *  *  any issue in a project, by providing the `projectKey`.
    * 
    * This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users from that range that match the search string and have permission to browse issues. This means the operation usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who match the search string and have permission to browse issues, use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-2-users-search-get) and filter the records in your code.
    * 
    * Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users' preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address is hidden. See the [Profile visibility overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/) for more details.
    * 
    * This operation can be accessed anonymously.
    * 
    * **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and groups* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg). Anonymous calls and calls by users without the required permission return empty search results.
     *
     * API Method: GET /rest/api/2/user/viewissue/search
     *
     * @param spec a consumer that creates the payload for this operation. Supports the following properties:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>query: A query string that is matched against user attributes, such as `displayName` and `emailAddress`, to find relevant users. The string can match the prefix of the attribute's value. For example, *query=john* matches a user with a `displayName` of *John Smith* and a user with an `emailAddress` of *johnson@example.com*. Required, unless `accountId` is specified.</li>
     *   <li>username: This parameter is no longer available. See the [deprecation notice](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/deprecation-notice-user-privacy-api-migration-guide/) for details.</li>
     *   <li>accountId: A query string that is matched exactly against user `accountId`. Required, unless `query` is specified.</li>
     *   <li>issueKey: The issue key for the issue. Required, unless `projectKey` is specified.</li>
     *   <li>projectKey: The project key for the project (case sensitive). Required, unless `issueKey` is specified.</li>
     *   <li>startAt: The index of the first item to return in a page of results (page offset).</li>
     *   <li>maxResults: The maximum number of items to return per page.</li>
     * </ul>
