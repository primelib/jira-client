Their presence depends on various factors; usually you need to manually request them in the context object sent in the payload, but some of them are added automatically under certain conditions.\n\n *  `user` ([User](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user)): The current user. Always available and equal to `null` if the request is anonymous.\n *  `app` ([App](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#app)): The [Connect app](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/index/#connect-apps) that made the request. Available only for authenticated requests made by Connect Apps (read more here: [Authentication for Connect apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/)).\n *  `issue` ([Issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): The current issue. Available only when the issue is provided in the request context object.\n *  `issues` ([List](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#list) of [Issues](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): A collection of issues matching a JQL query. Available only when JQL is provided in the request context object.\n *  `project` ([Project](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#project)): The current project. Available only when the project is provided in the request context object.\n *  `sprint` ([Sprint](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#sprint)): The current sprint. Available only when the sprint is provided in the request context object.\n *  `board` ([Board](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#board)): The current board. Available only when the board is provided in the request context object.\n *  `serviceDesk` ([ServiceDesk](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#servicedesk)): The current service desk. Available only when the service desk is provided in the request context object.\n *  `customerRequest` ([CustomerRequest](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#customerrequest)): The current customer request. Available only when the customer request is provided in the request context object.\n\nAlso, custom context variables can be passed in the request with their types. Those variables can be accessed by key in the Jira expression. These variable types are available for use in a custom context:\n\n *  `user`: A [user](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user) specified as an Atlassian account ID.\n *  `issue`: An [issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue) specified by ID or key. All the fields of the issue object are available in the Jira expression.\n *  `json`: A JSON object containing custom content.\n *  `list`: A JSON list of `user`, `issue`, or `json` variable types.\n\nThis operation can be accessed anonymously.\n\n**[Permissions](#permissions) required**: None. However, an expression may return different results for different users depending on their permissions. For example, different users may see different comments on the same issue.  \nPermission to access Jira Software is required to access Jira Software context variables (`board` and `sprint`) or fields (for example, `issue.sprint`)."

The properties of the field configuration fields provided override the existing values.\n\nThis operation can only update field configurations used in company-managed (classic) projects.\n\nThe operation can set the renderer for text fields to the default text renderer (`text-renderer`) or wiki style renderer (`wiki-renderer`). However, the renderer cannot be updated for fields using the autocomplete renderer (`autocomplete-renderer`).\n\nHiding a field deletes it from the field configuration - deleting the required, description and renderer type values as well. As a result, hiding and unhiding will not restore the other values but use their default values.\n\n**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg)."

      description: "Returns a list of permissions indicating which permissions the user has. Details of the user's permissions can be obtained in a global, project, issue or comment context.\n\nThe user is reported as having a project permission:\n\n *  in the global context, if the user has the project permission in any project.\n *  for a project, where the project permission is determined using issue data, if the user meets the permission's criteria for any issue in the project. Otherwise, if the user has the project permission in the project.\n *  for an issue, where a project permission is determined using issue data, if the user has the permission in the issue. Otherwise, if the user has the project permission in the project containing the issue.\n *  for a comment, where the user has both the permission to browse the comment and the project permission for the comment's parent issue. Only the BROWSE\\_PROJECTS permission is supported. If a `commentId` is provided whose `permissions` does not equal BROWSE\\_PROJECTS, a 400 error will be returned.\n\nThis means that users may be shown as having an issue permission (such as EDIT\\_ISSUES) in the global context or a project context but may not have the permission for any or all issues. For example, if Reporters have the EDIT\\_ISSUES permission a user would be shown as having this permission in the global context or the context of a project, because any user can be a reporter. However, if they are not the user who reported the issue queried they would not have EDIT\\_ISSUES permission for that issue.\n\nFor [Jira Service Management project permissions](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/customize-jira-service-management-permissions/), this will be evaluated similarly to a user in the customer portal. For example, if the BROWSE\\_PROJECTS permission is granted to Service Project Customer - Portal Access, any users with access to the customer portal will have the BROWSE\\_PROJECTS permission.\n\nGlobal permissions are unaffected by context.\n\nThis operation can be accessed anonymously.\n\n**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** None."

      description: "Returns all permission schemes.\n\n### About permission schemes and grants ###\n\nA permission scheme is a collection of permission grants. A permission grant consists of a `holder` and a `permission`.\n\n#### Holder object ####\n\nThe `holder` object contains information about the user or group being granted the permission. For example, the *Administer projects* permission is granted to a group named *Teams in space administrators*. In this case, the type is `\"type\": \"group\"`, and the parameter is the group name, `\"parameter\": \"Teams in space administrators\"` and the value is group ID, `\"value\": \"ca85fac0-d974-40ca-a615-7af99c48d24f\"`.\n\nThe `holder` object is defined by the following properties:\n\n *  `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below).\n *  `parameter` As a group's name can change, use of `value` is recommended. The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name.\n *  `value` The value of this property depends on the `type`. If the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group ID. For other `type` it has the same value as `parameter`\n\nThe following `types` are available. The expected values for `parameter` and `value` are given in parentheses (some types may not have a `parameter` or `value`):\n\n *  `anyone` Grant for anonymous users.\n *  `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name, application name). See [Update product access settings](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3YxjL) for more information.\n *  `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue.\n *  `group` Grant for the specified group (`parameter` : group name, `value` : group ID).\n *  `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (`parameter` : custom field ID, `value` : custom field ID).\n *  `projectLead` Grant for a project lead.\n *  `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (`parameter` :project role ID, `value` : project role ID).\n *  `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue.\n *  `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24dKLg) for more information.\n *  `user` Grant for the specified user (`parameter` : user ID - historically this was the userkey but that is deprecated and the account ID should be used, `value` : user ID).\n *  `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (`parameter` : custom field ID, `value` : custom field ID).\n\n#### Built-in permissions ####\n\nThe [built-in Jira permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) are listed below. Apps can also define custom permissions. See the [project permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/project-permission/) and [global permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/global-permission/) module documentation for more information.\n\n**Administration permissions**\n\n *  `ADMINISTER_PROJECTS`\n *  `EDIT_WORKFLOW`\n *  `EDIT_ISSUE_LAYOUT`\n\n**Project permissions**\n\n *  `BROWSE_PROJECTS`\n *  `MANAGE_SPRINTS_PERMISSION` (Jira Software only)\n *  `SERVICEDESK_AGENT` (Jira Service Desk only)\n *  `VIEW_DEV_TOOLS` (Jira Software only)\n *  `VIEW_READONLY_WORKFLOW`\n\n**Issue permissions**\n\n *  `ASSIGNABLE_USER`\n *  `ASSIGN_ISSUES`\n *  `CLOSE_ISSUES`\n *  `CREATE_ISSUES`\n *  `DELETE_ISSUES`\n *  `EDIT_ISSUES`\n *  `LINK_ISSUES`\n *  `MODIFY_REPORTER`\n *  `MOVE_ISSUES`\n *  `RESOLVE_ISSUES`\n *  `SCHEDULE_ISSUES`\n *  `SET_ISSUE_SECURITY`\n *  `TRANSITION_ISSUES`\n\n**Voters and watchers permissions**\n\n *  `MANAGE_WATCHERS`\n *  `VIEW_VOTERS_AND_WATCHERS`\n\n**Comments permissions**\n\n *  `ADD_COMMENTS`\n *  `DELETE_ALL_COMMENTS`\n *  `DELETE_OWN_COMMENTS`\n *  `EDIT_ALL_COMMENTS`\n *  `EDIT_OWN_COMMENTS`\n\n**Attachments permissions**\n\n *  `CREATE_ATTACHMENTS`\n *  `DELETE_ALL_ATTACHMENTS`\n *  `DELETE_OWN_ATTACHMENTS`\n\n**Time tracking permissions**\n\n *  `DELETE_ALL_WORKLOGS`\n *  `DELETE_OWN_WORKLOGS`\n *  `EDIT_ALL_WORKLOGS`\n *  `EDIT_OWN_WORKLOGS`\n *  `WORK_ON_ISSUES`\n\n**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access Jira."

In Jira Cloud, the list of project roles is shared globally with all projects, but each project can have a different set of actors associated with it (unlike groups, which have the same membership throughout all Jira applications).\n\nProject roles are used in [permission schemes](#api-rest-api-2-permissionscheme-get), [email notification schemes](#api-rest-api-2-notificationscheme-get), [issue security levels](#api-rest-api-2-issuesecurityschemes-get), [comment visibility](#api-rest-api-2-comment-list-post), and workflow conditions.\n\n#### Members and actors ####\n\nIn the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is called an *actor*. An *actor* is a group or user associated with a project role.\n\nActors may be set as [default members](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-project-roles/#Specifying-'default-members'-for-a-project-role) of the project role or set at the project level:\n\n *  Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects. The default actors can be removed at the project level later if desired.\n *  Actors: Users and groups that are associated with a project role for a project, which may differ from the default actors. This enables you to assign a user to different roles in different projects.\n\n**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg)."

For example, if user property `location` is set to value `{\"office\": {\"country\": \"AU\", \"city\": \"Sydney\"}}`, then it's possible to use `[location].office.city is \"Sydney\"` to match the user.\n\nThe list of issues can be extended as needed, as in *(PROJ-1, PROJ-2, ...

You can define transition rules using the shapes detailed in the following sections. If no transitional rules are specified the default system transition rules are used. Note: This only applies to company-managed scoped workflows.\n\n#### Conditions ####\n\nConditions enable workflow rules that govern whether a transition can execute.\n\n##### Always false condition #####\n\nA condition that always fails.\n\n    {\n       \"type\": \"AlwaysFalseCondition\"\n     }\n\n##### Block transition until approval #####\n\nA condition that blocks issue transition if there is a pending approval.\n\n    {\n       \"type\": \"BlockInProgressApprovalCondition\"\n     }\n\n##### Compare number custom field condition #####\n\nA condition that allows transition if a comparison between a number custom field and a value is true.\n\n    {\n       \"type\": \"CompareNumberCFCondition\",\n       \"configuration\": {\n         \"comparator\": \"=\",\n         \"fieldId\": \"customfield_10029\",\n         \"fieldValue\": 2\n       }\n     }\n\n *  `comparator` One of the supported comparator: `=`, `>`, and `<`.\n *  `fieldId` The custom numeric field ID.

PCRI format is defined as follows: pcri:\\[entityType\\]:\\[type\\]:\\[entityId\\] entityType - the type of an entity, e.g. status, role, workflow type - PCRI type, either `id` - The ID of an entity that already exists in the target site, or `ref` - A unique reference to an entity that is being created entityId - entity identifier, if type is `id` - must be an existing entity ID that exists in the Jira site, if `ref` - must be unique across all entities in the scope of this project template creation"
